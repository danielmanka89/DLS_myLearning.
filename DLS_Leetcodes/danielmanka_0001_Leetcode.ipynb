    "\n",
    "The Two Sum problem asks us to find two specific numbers in a list that, when added together, equal a given target. While this sounds simple, the challenge lies in the constraints: we can only use each specific element once, and we need to return their indices (their positions), not the numbers themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are in a room of people, and everyone is wearing a numbered badge. You are told to find two people whose badge numbers sum to 50. The \"Brute Force\" way to do this is to pick one person and ask every other person in the room to add their number to the first person's. If you don't find a match, you move to the second person and repeat. This is slow because if there are 100 people, you might end up making thousands of comparisons. However, a smarter way is to use a \"Check-in Desk\" (a Hash Map). As each person walks by, you calculate exactly what number you need to reach 50 (the complement). You check your desk records to see if a person with that specific number has already checked in. If they have, the search is over; if not, you write down the current person's number and their location. This allows you to find the pair by only talking to each person exactly once."
